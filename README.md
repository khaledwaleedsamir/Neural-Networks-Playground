# 🧠 Neural-Networks-Playground
Welcome to the Neural-Networks-Playground — a journey through the evolving landscape of machine learning, from classical algorithms to cutting-edge large language models and agentic AI systems.

This repository contains coursework, assignments, and personal experiments from a comprehensive curriculum covering:

🏁 Classical Machine Learning (SVMs, Decision Trees, k-NN, etc.)

🔬 Foundations of Neural Networks (Perceptrons, MLPs, backpropagation)

🧱 Deep Learning Architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Autoencoders, etc.)

🌐 Transformers and Attention

🤖 Large Language Models (LLMs)

🧠 Agentic AI and Autonomous Systems
