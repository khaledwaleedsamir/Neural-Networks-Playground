# 🧠 Neural-Networks-Playground
Welcome to the Neural-Networks-Playground — a journey through the evolving landscape of machine learning, from classical algorithms to cutting-edge large language models and agentic AI systems.

This repository contains materials from my Neural Networks course, including assignments, applied labs, and personal experiments. It serves as a learning archive and a sandbox for trying out ideas beyond the classroom.

## 🛠️ Projects

This repository includes practical projects that apply classical ML and modern deep learning techniques to real-world tasks. More projects will be added soon.

### [🧮 Classical Machine Learning on ReducedMNIST](./Classical%20ML)

### [🔊 Digit Speech Recognition with Spectrograms (FSDD)](./Speech%20Recognition%20from%20Speech%20Spectrum)

### [🧠 Benchmarking LLMs on Arabic Q/A Dataset](./Benchmarking%20LLMs)

*More work will be uploaded in the future 🌱.*
